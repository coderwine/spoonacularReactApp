## Finding Something to Eat

The concept of this build is mostly to build out a small project to help students and those trying to learn how to debug a React application.

Using the [**Spoonacular API**](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs), students will need to look through the docs, obtain an API key and import that as they desire.  I have created a **keys.js** file and housed my personal key there.  This was then placed in the **gitignore** for obvious reasons.


## Minor Bugs:
- SearchRecipe.jsx - would like for the search bar to be smaller on full screen.
- searches that result in items greater than 900 offset need to be accounted for.
- Not clearing search field.
- Pagination needs to be connected.
